## Give the run time for each of these scenarios in terms of Big O.


1.3 You have a name, and you want to find the person’s phone number in the phone book.
> i have a name and the book sorted alphabetically so i can use binary search which have a run time of `O(Log(n))`

1.4 You have a phone number, and you want to find the person’s name
in the phone book. (Hint: You’ll have to search through the whole
book!)
> in this case i will use simple search algorithm which have run time of `O(n)`(Linear Type)

1.5 You want to read the numbers of every person in the phone book.
> in this case i will use simple search algorithm which have run time of `O(n)`(Linear Type)

1.6 You want to read the numbers of just the As. (This is a tricky one!
It involves concepts that are covered more in chapter 4. Read the
answer—you may be surprised!)

>i will go through the book from the begin till i found first b letter and stop so it run time of `O(n)`
